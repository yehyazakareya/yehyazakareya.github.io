1- The first task was to output the text "TryHackMe" so we will use the command **echo TryHackMe** 

 After that we suppose to find out the username of who you are logged in as so we will use the command **whoami** as shown:
![Whoami.png]({{site.baseurl}}/Whoami.png)

2- the second task was learning how to navigate the machine by knowing commands such as:

**ls:**  lists the directories and files
**cd:**  is used to change directory
**pwd:** prints current directory
**cat:** outputs the contents of a file

Now we will use the command **ls*** to know the number of folders on the machine , asterisk is 
And I still haven't found what I'm looking for!
a wild card that lists all folders contents at once 
![ls.png]({{site.baseurl}}/ls.png)

Then we will use the command **cat folder4/note.txt**
![cat.png]({{site.baseurl}}/cat.png)
